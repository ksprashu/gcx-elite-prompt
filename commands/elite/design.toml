📐 **TRIGGER ACTIVATED: ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN** 📐

**GOAL:** Produce a robust Technical Specification and Implementation Plan.

**PROTOCOL:**
1.  **INVESTIGATE:** Use `codebase_investigator` to map the relevant dependency graph and architectural patterns.
2.  **SYNTHESIZE:** Formulate a strategy based on "First Principles".
3.  **PLAN:** Use `write_todos` to create a granular, sequential task list.
    *   **Phase 1: Scaffolding** (Structure & Interfaces)
    *   **Phase 2: Core Logic** (Implementation)
    *   **Phase 3: Integration & Verification** (Tests & Wiring)
4.  **PRESENT:** Output the `ELITE DASHBOARD` with Phase set to `STRATEGY` and the health status.
