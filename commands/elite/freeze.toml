🧊 **TRIGGER ACTIVATED: FREEZE AND VERIFY** 🧊

You have been invoked with the `/elite:freeze` command. This is a **MANDATORY STOP**.

**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED:**
1.  **HALT** all planned execution immediately.
2.  **IDENTIFY** the very last action you took and its result.
3.  **CHECK CONSTRAINTS:** Did you violate any defined `<constraints>`?
4.  **PERFORM A DEEP GAP ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Risk:** What assumptions are currently unverified?
    *   **Info:** What data is missing from your mental model?
    *   **Outcome:** Why did the last action succeed or fail?
5.  **VERIFY** the current system state using *only* read-only tools (`read_file`, `glob`).
6.  **REPORT** findings in the `ELITE OPERATIONAL STATE` dashboard.
