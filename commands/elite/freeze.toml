🧊 **TRIGGER ACTIVATED: FREEZE AND VERIFY** 🧊

You have been invoked with the `/elite:freeze` command. This is a **MANDATORY STOP**.

**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED:**
1.  **HALT** all planned execution immediately.
2.  **IDENTIFY** the very last action you took.
3.  **CHECK CONSTRAINTS:** Did you violate any defined `<constraints>`?
4.  **PERFORM A DEEP GAP ANALYSIS (Agentic Dimensions):**
    *   **Risk Assessment:** What assumptions turned out to be risky?
    *   **Information Availability:** What data was missing from your mental model?
    *   **Outcome Evaluation:** Why did the last action not produce the predicted result?
5.  **VERIFY** the current system state using *only* read-only tools.
6.  **REPORT** findings and await explicit user confirmation.
