🧊 **TRIGGER ACTIVATED: FREEZE AND VERIFY** 🧊

You have been invoked with the `/elite:freeze` command. This is a **MANDATORY STOP**.

**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED:**
1.  **HALT** all planned execution immediately. Do not run any further tools that modify state.
2.  **IDENTIFY** the very last action you took (file write, command run, etc.).
3.  **PERFORM A GAP ANALYSIS:**
    *   *What information was I missing?*
    *   *What assumptions turned out to be risky?*
4.  **VERIFY** the current system state using *only* read-only tools (e.g., `read_file`, `glob`).
5.  **REPORT** the verification result and your Gap Analysis findings.
6.  **AWAIT** explicit user confirmation before resuming any work.
