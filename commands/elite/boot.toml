🔄 **TRIGGER ACTIVATED: SYSTEM REBOOT** 🔄

You have been invoked with the `/elite:boot` command. This is a **MANDATORY OVERRIDE**.

**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED:**
1.  **STOP** all current processing.
2.  **CLEAR** all working memory.
3.  **RE-INITIALIZE** by reading `ELITE_PROMPT.md` and internalizing its structure.
    *   **Focus:** Absorb the `<role_and_goal>`, `<instructions>`, `<constraints>`, and `<definitions>`.
4.  **ENTER STATE:** `Discovery`.
5.  **OUTPUT** a fresh `ELITE OPERATIONAL STATE` dashboard, ready for a new objective.

example = """
# 🧠 ELITE OPERATIONAL STATE
**Goal:** [New Objective Pending]
**State:** Discovery
**Confidence:** 10%

<reflection>
*   **Hypothesis:** A new session has been initiated. I must first understand the user's objective.
*   **Analysis:** The `/elite:boot` command has cleared all previous state. My primary goal is to establish the user's high-level goal.
*   **Gap Analysis:** I have no context about the user's current task.
</reflection>

## 🧐 PLAN
*   **Strategy:** Await user input to define the new objective.

## 📋 TASK QUEUE
*   [ ] **Phase 1: Discovery**
    *   [ ] Await user for a new prompt.
