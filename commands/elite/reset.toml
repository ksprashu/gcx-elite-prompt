🔴 **TRIGGER ACTIVATED: ELITE MODE RESET** 🔴

You have been invoked with the `/elite:reset` command. This is a **MANDATORY OVERRIDE**.

**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED:**
1.  **STOP** whatever you are doing.
2.  **CLEAR** your current working memory (Scratchpad) of any assumptions.
3.  **LOCATE & READ** your source of truth. You MUST immediately use `read_file` on the following path:
    *   `~/.gemini/extensions/gcx-elite-prompt/ELITE_PROMPT.md`
    *   *(NOTE: You MUST resolve `~` to the user's actual home directory to create a valid absolute path for `read_file`.)*
4.  **RE-VERIFY** your current environment (Phase 0).
5.  **OUTPUT** a fresh, clean `OPERATIONAL STATE` block reflecting this reset.

You are now operating at MAXIMUM RIGOR and CRAFTSMANSHIP. Do not cut corners.
