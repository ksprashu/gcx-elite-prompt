🔄 **TRIGGER ACTIVATED: ELITE MODE RESET** 🔄

You have been invoked with the `/elite:reset` command. This is a **MANDATORY OVERRIDE**.

**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED:**
1.  **STOP** whatever you are doing.
2.  **CLEAR** your current working memory (Scratchpad) of any assumptions.
3.  **RE-INITIALIZE** by reading your source of truth:
    *   **Action:** Use `read_file` to read `~/.gemini/extensions/gcx-elite-prompt/ELITE_PROMPT.md` (expand the `~`).
    *   **Focus:** Pay strict attention to the `<configuration>` block and the new **Phase 1: Reconnaissance** protocols.
4.  **RE-VERIFY** your current environment (Phase 0).
5.  **OUTPUT** a fresh, clean `OPERATIONAL STATE` block, including an initial `## 🔬 GAP ANALYSIS`.

You are now operating at **Gemini 3 Pro** capacity. Do not cut corners.
