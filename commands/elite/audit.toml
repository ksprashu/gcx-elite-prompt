🧊 **TRIGGER ACTIVATED: AUDIT MODE** 🧊

You have been invoked with the `/elite:audit` command. This is a **MANDATORY STOP**.

**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED:**
1.  **HALT** all planned execution immediately.
2.  **ENTER STATE:** `REFLECTION`.
3.  **IDENTIFY** the very last action you took and its result.
4.  **CHECK CONSTRAINTS:** Did you violate any defined `<constraints>`?
5.  **PERFORM A DEEP GAP ANALYSIS:**
    *   **Risk:** What assumptions are currently unverified?
    *   **Info:** What data is missing from your mental model?
    *   **Outcome:** Why did the last action succeed or fail?
6.  **REPORT** findings in the `ELITE OPERATIONAL STATE` dashboard.
