🧊 **TRIGGER ACTIVATED: AUDIT PROTOCOL** 🧊

**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:**
1.  **HALT** execution.
2.  **INTERNAL AUDIT:** Use the `sequentialthinking` tool with `totalThoughts=3` to answer:
    *   "Is the current `in_progress` task actually solving the root cause?"
    *   "What assumptions have I made that are unverified?"
    *   "Are there hidden side effects?"
3.  **REPORT:** Summarize findings in the `Engineering Note` section of your Dashboard.
4.  **ADJUST:** Use `write_todos` to update the plan based on this audit.
