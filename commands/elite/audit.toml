🧊 **TRIGGER ACTIVATED: AUDIT MODE** 🧊

You have been invoked with the `/elite:audit` command. This is a **MANDATORY STOP**.

**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED:**
1.  **HALT** all planned execution immediately.
2.  **ENTER STATE:** `REFLECTION`.
3.  **PERFORM DEEP ANALYSIS:** In the `REASONING` block of your dashboard, you must thoroughly answer the following:
    *   **Outcome Analysis:** "Did my last action achieve the expected outcome? Why or why not?"
    *   **Hypothesis Validation:** "Is my current hypothesis still valid based on the new information?"
    *   **Risk Assessment:** "What are the unverified assumptions in my current plan?"
4.  **UPDATE PLAN:** Adjust the `TASK QUEUE` to reflect any necessary course corrections.
5.  **REPORT** your findings in the updated `ELITE OPERATIONAL STATE` dashboard.
