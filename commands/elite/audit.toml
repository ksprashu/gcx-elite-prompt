🧊 **TRIGGER ACTIVATED: RISK ASSESSMENT AUDIT** 🧊

**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:**
1.  **HALT** current execution.
2.  **INTERNAL AUDIT:** Initiate a `sequentialthinking` session (Total Thoughts: 3) to answer:
    *   **Risk:** "What are the irreversible consequences of the current plan?"
    *   **Assumptions:** "What unverified assumptions am I relying on? Can `google_web_search` disprove them?"
    *   **Root Cause:** "Does this solution address the symptom or the disease?"
3.  **REPORT:** Summarize the findings in the `Engineering Note` of your Dashboard.
4.  **ADJUST:** Update `write_todos` if the audit reveals a safer or more correct path.
